                   The first video game played in space was "Tetris". In 1993, Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr A. Serebrov took a Game Boy with a copy of Tetris aboard the Soyuz TM-17 mission to the Mir Space Station. He played the game during his time in orbit, making Tetris the first known video game to be played beyond Earth.

The actual Game Boy and the Tetris cartridge used in space were later auctioned off as a unique piece of gaming and space history.

                    The game widely regarded as the worst video game ever created is "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" for the Atari 2600, released in 1982. Several factors contributed to this negative reputation:

Rushed Development: The game was developed in just over five weeks to meet the deadline for the holiday shopping season, which severely limited its quality and playability.

Confusing Gameplay: The game’s mechanics were poorly explained, leaving players confused about objectives and how to progress. The game world was full of frustrating design flaws, like E.T. constantly falling into pits, making it difficult to enjoy.

Massive Overproduction: Atari produced millions of cartridges, expecting the game to be a huge success due to the popularity of the E.T. movie. However, the game was so poorly received that most copies went unsold, leading to huge financial losses.

Infamous Atari Burial: In one of the most well-known stories in video game history, Atari allegedly buried unsold copies of E.T. in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico. This urban legend was confirmed in 2014 when an excavation unearthed copies of the game.

                    The most-played video game of all time is "Minecraft". With over 240 million copies sold and hundreds of millions of active players across various platforms, Minecraft holds the record not only for sales but also for its massive player base. The game's open-world, sandbox design allows for virtually endless gameplay possibilities, which helps retain players over long periods and attract new ones continuously.

Other games like "Fortnite" and "PUBG: Battlegrounds" have also amassed large player bases, but Minecraft’s broad accessibility, cross-platform availability, and appeal across age groups have solidified it as the most-played game in history.
